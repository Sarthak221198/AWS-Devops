# AWS DevOps Project: CI/CD with CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using AWS DevOps services, including:

- AWS CodeBuild â†’ Builds the application
- AWS CodeDeploy â†’ Deploys the application to EC2 or other environments
- AWS CodePipeline â†’ Automates the workflow from source to deployment

ðŸŽ¯ Project Workflow

- Developers push changes to a GitHub repository.
- AWS CodePipeline detects the change and triggers the process.

# Build Phase (AWS CodeBuild)

- The application source code is retrieved.
- CodeBuild runs unit tests and creates an artifact.
- The built package is stored in an S3 bucket.

# Deployment Phase (AWS CodeDeploy)

- CodeDeploy fetches the artifact from S3.
- Deploys the application to EC2 instances, ECS, or Lambda.
- Uses deployment strategies like Blue-Green or Rolling Updates.

# Pipeline Execution (AWS CodePipeline)

- Automates the entire process.
- Ensures seamless deployments.

# ðŸ›  Technologies Used
âœ… AWS Services: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, S3, EC2, IAM
âœ… Version Control: GitHub
âœ… Build Automation: CodeBuild (buildspec.yml)
âœ… Deployment Strategy: In Line deployment

# Results
